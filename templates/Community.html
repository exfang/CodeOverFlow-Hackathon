                     At CC, we believe that <strong>recycling between 2022 and 2050 will reduce emissions by 5.5-6.02  gigatons of carbon dioxide</strong>
                      (equivalent to taking over 1 billion cars off the streets for one year).
                      That is a major reduction from a simple lifestyle change, which makes <strong>recycling an effective,
                       yet easy change to make</strong> to help curb greenhouse gas emissions and help limit the climate crisis.</p>

                    <p>SINGAPORE - The National Environment Agency (NEA) is stepping up a gear to nudge people to speed up their recycling pace, working with public waste collectors to distribute a recycling bin to each household in 2022.
                        <br> 
                        The hope is that "these bins will make it more convenient for Singaporeans to store recyclables in their homes before bringing them down to the recycling bins in their areas", said Mr Desmond Tan, Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment, on Friday (Jan 14).

                    <p>Singaporeans are recycling, but they are not necessarily doing it right.
<br>
                        According to two household recycling surveys conducted by the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) and the National Environment Agency (NEA) recently, six in 10 Singaporeans recycle regularly, but knowledge about what can and cannot be recycled needs to be improved.

                    <p>Small incentives could be a way to encourage Singaporeans to recycle more, and that is what F&N Foods hopes to do with its new green initiative.

                        In partnership with FairPrice, Frasers Centrepoint Malls and tech start-up Incon Green, F&N has installed a reverse vending machine outside Waterway Point's FairPrice Finest outlet in Punggol.
